# Be-The-Bindra
This project aims to design a third person shooting in which the game challenges the player to use his/her capability to perform the required action in each level of the game. There are 5 levels to complete and the difficulty increases in each level. Each level has target to score in a given period of time. The player is also given a chance to score bonus points. After acquiring the required score, the player automatically reaches to the next level of the game. The name of the game is 
“Be The Bindra”.
